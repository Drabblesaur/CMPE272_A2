# Reflection

Since I coded this assignment in Javascript I was not given template code from the assignment. It took a bit of time to understand the API to use DynamoDB and I used some tutorials to learn what some methods do. I believe that was the hardest part of the assignment. Setting Up DynamoDB was easy and using API Gateway was a little bit more difficult. During the API Gateway setup I had a bit of confusion on how to set up the routes but I eventually got the hang of it at the end.
